## 🧠 About ArdiA Health Labs

ArdiA Health Labs is building a **Clinical Reasoning Engine** that transforms healthcare AI from "alerting to solving."

- **20+ chronic conditions** - Asthma, COPD, CKD, CHF, Diabetes, and more
- **Proven results** - 74% ER reduction in pilot program
- **Revenue generation** - $200K+/year for clinics through optimized care management
