Dear Sean,

Virtue VC's focus on the "business of care"—data, dollars, and delivery—perfectly describes what Ardia Health is building for chronic disease management.

**Addressing Data, Dollars, and Delivery:**

| Virtue VC Focus | Ardia Health Solution |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Data** | Clinical reasoning engine transforms patient data into actionable intelligence |
| **Dollars** | Generates $200K+ annual revenue for clinics; reduces ER visits 65% |
| **Delivery** | Integrates into clinical workflows for seamless care delivery |

**Why Chronic Care:**
Your portfolio includes Nomi Health (pricing transparency) and Evvy (women's health testing). Chronic disease management represents the **90% of healthcare spending** that lacks similar innovation—asthma, COPD, kidney disease management remains underserved.

**Our Differentiation:**
Unlike competitors focused on acute care imaging or single-condition applications, Ardia Health provides:
- Explainable clinical reasoning (not black-box AI)
- Multi-condition coverage (20+ chronic conditions)
- Independent clinic focus (underserved market)

**Investment Profile:**
- Stage: Pre-seed/Seed
- Ask: $500K-$1M range (aligned with your typical check size)
- Use: Pilot deployments, clinical validation, initial sales

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss how Ardia Health fits your investment thesis.
