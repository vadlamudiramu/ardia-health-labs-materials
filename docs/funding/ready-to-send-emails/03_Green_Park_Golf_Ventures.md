Dear Green Park & Golf Ventures Team,

Your investment in OncoLens and BioIQ demonstrates a clear thesis: healthcare transformation through data-driven technology. Ardia Health is pursuing this same mission for chronic disease management—an area representing **90% of US healthcare spending**.

**The Market Gap:**
While oncology (Tempus) and acute care (Viz.ai) have attracted AI innovation, chronic conditions like asthma, COPD, and CKD remain underserved. Independent clinics managing these conditions lack tools that provide actionable, explainable clinical intelligence.

**Ardia Health's Approach:**
We've built a Clinical Reasoning Engine that:
- Goes beyond alerting to provide **clinical rationale** providers can act on
- Addresses **20+ chronic conditions** vs. competitors' narrow focus
- Demonstrates ROI within **90 days** through reduced hospitalizations and optimized care pathways
- Serves as **enterprise-ready software** with SaaS economics

**Strategic Fit:**
As a Dallas-based company targeting DFW healthcare systems initially, we're positioned to leverage local relationships before national expansion. Your portfolio expertise in healthcare data platforms makes Green Park & Golf an ideal partner.

I'd welcome the opportunity to present our platform and discuss a potential seed investment.

Best regards,
