---

Dear Arvin and Steve,

DHVP's exclusive focus on healthcare software and AI-enabled services—combined with your portfolio including Suki, Health Gorilla, and Luma—demonstrates exactly the type of company we aspire to build. Ardia Health is seeking seed investment to accelerate our Clinical Reasoning Engine platform.

**Direct Alignment with Your Thesis:**
Your investment sectors—Software (AI/SaaS), AI-enabled services, healthcare consumerism—describe our platform:
- **AI/SaaS:** Cloud-based clinical reasoning delivered as B2B SaaS
- **AI-enabled services:** Transforms chronic care management with explainable AI
- **Healthcare access:** Enables independent clinics to deliver enterprise-level care

**Our Differentiation:**
Your portfolio includes ArcHouse (hospice operations) and Avo (clinical workflows). Ardia Health focuses on **chronic disease clinical reasoning**—a gap in the healthcare AI market where 90% of costs occur but minimal AI innovation exists.

**What We've Built:**
- Clinical Reasoning Engine covering 20+ chronic conditions
- Explainable AI that provides clinical justification (not black-box recommendations)
- Dashboard demonstrated and ready for pilot deployment
- Initial pipeline of 15+ independent clinics

**Investment Ask:**
Seed round to fund pilot deployments, clinical validation, and initial sales team.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to present our platform and discuss partnership.

Best regards,
