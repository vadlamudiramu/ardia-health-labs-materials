**Subject:** Healthcare AI SaaS: Seeking Seed Investment for Clinical Reasoning Platform

---

Dear Dallas Venture Capital Team,

Your investment in IntelliDoctor signals interest in AI-driven healthcare solutions—I'm reaching out about Ardia Health, a clinical AI platform tackling chronic disease management for independent healthcare providers.

**The Opportunity:**
Chronic conditions (asthma, COPD, kidney disease) account for 90% of healthcare costs yet remain underserved by AI innovation. Independent clinics need technology that integrates with existing workflows and delivers immediate clinical value.

**Our Platform:**
Ardia Health has built a Clinical Reasoning Engine providing:
- **Explainable AI** that clinicians trust (not black-box recommendations)
- **Multi-condition coverage** for comprehensive chronic care management
- **SaaS delivery model** with predictable B2B revenue
- **Data infrastructure** designed for healthcare compliance and scale

**Why DVC:**
Your DVC Advantage program—customer introductions, go-to-market playbooks, growth mentorship—is precisely what we need as we move from platform development to commercial deployment.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss how Ardia Health fits your healthcare AI thesis and explore partnership.

You can view our interactive business documents and architecture here:
- **Live Demo:** https://vlajul3oeejn.space.minimax.io
- **GitHub Repository & Docs:** https://vadlamudiramu.github.io/ardia-health-labs-materials/

I have also attached our pitch deck and a technical whitepaper for your convenience.

Best regards,  
Ram Vadlamudi  
Founder, Ardia Health
