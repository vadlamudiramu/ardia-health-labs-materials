**Subject:** Healthcare AI Platform: Clinical Reasoning Engine for Chronic Disease Management

---

Dear Justin,

a16z's healthcare thesis—active engagement in digital health with emphasis on full-stack tech-enabled services—aligns with what we're building at Ardia Health.

**The Opportunity:**
Your portfolio includes Omada (chronic condition management), Komodo (healthcare intelligence), and Ribbon Health (provider data). Ardia Health fills a critical gap: **clinical reasoning** for chronic conditions that existing platforms don't address.

**Our Differentiation:**
| Current Market | Ardia Health |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Alerting (high fatigue) | Reasoning (actionable) |
| Single-condition focus | 20+ conditions |
| Acute care emphasis | Chronic care focus |
| Black-box AI | Explainable clinical logic |

**Why Now:**
Healthcare AI spending hit $1.4B in 2025 (3x 2024). Chronic conditions represent 90% of healthcare costs but receive minimal AI innovation. Independent clinics are actively seeking solutions—the timing is optimal.

**Traction:**
- Platform built and demonstrated
- 15+ clinic pipeline in DFW region
- Clear path to $1M ARR within 18 months

I'd welcome 20 minutes to demonstrate our platform and discuss how Ardia Health extends a16z's healthcare AI portfolio.

You can view our interactive business documents and architecture here:
- **Live Demo:** https://vlajul3oeejn.space.minimax.io
- **GitHub Repository & Docs:** https://vadlamudiramu.github.io/ardia-health-labs-materials/

I have also attached our pitch deck and a technical whitepaper for your convenience.

Best regards,  
Ram Vadlamudi  
Founder, Ardia Health
