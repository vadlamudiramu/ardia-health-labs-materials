Dear Holly and Mo,

General Catalyst's "Health Assurance" vision—a proactive healthcare system that bends the cost curve while improving quality and access—describes exactly what Ardia Health is building for chronic disease management.

**Alignment with Health Assurance:**
| Health Assurance Goal | Ardia Health Contribution |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Bend cost curve | 65% ER reduction through early intervention |
| Improve quality | Explainable AI enables better clinical decisions |
| Increase access | Independent clinics get enterprise-level tools |
| Proactive vs. reactive | Reasoning engine identifies issues before crises |

**The Opportunity:**
Chronic conditions (asthma, COPD, kidney disease) represent 90% of healthcare spending. Most AI innovation focuses on acute care—we're building the intelligence layer for chronic care prevention and management.

**Our Platform:**
- Clinical Reasoning Engine (not just alerting)
- 20+ chronic conditions in unified platform
- Explainable AI that providers trust
- Demonstrated ROI within 90 days

**Why General Catalyst:**
Your transformational approach and stage flexibility (seed to pre-IPO) make you an ideal long-term partner. We're building a platform that can fundamentally change how chronic diseases are managed—aligned with your Health Assurance mission.

I'd welcome the opportunity to present our vision and discuss partnership.
