**Subject:** Contrarian Healthcare AI: Clinical Reasoning for Chronic Disease Management

---

Dear Deena,

Lux Capital's willingness to make long-term bets on contrarians challenging the status quo resonates with our approach at Ardia Health.

**The Contrarian Thesis:**
While healthcare AI investment floods into acute care (radiology, stroke detection, ICU monitoring), we're building for chronic disease management—the **90% of healthcare spending** that receives **minimal AI innovation**.

**Why This is Contrarian:**
- Conventional wisdom: AI should focus on high-acuity, image-heavy specialties
- Our belief: The biggest impact is in chronic care where most spending occurs
- Conventional wisdom: Clinical AI should alert and flag
- Our belief: Clinical AI should reason and explain

**Our Platform:**
Ardia Health's Clinical Reasoning Engine provides explainable clinical intelligence for asthma, COPD, kidney disease, and 17+ additional chronic conditions. We're targeting independent clinics—an underserved market ignored by enterprise-focused competitors.

**Why Lux:**
Your portfolio includes Alife (AI-assisted fertility) and Summer Health (pediatric care)—demonstrating appetite for AI applications in underserved clinical areas. Chronic disease management is the largest underserved area in healthcare AI.

I'd welcome a conversation about how Ardia Health fits your investment thesis.
