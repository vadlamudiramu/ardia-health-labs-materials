**Subject:** AI-Enabled Healthcare SaaS: Clinical Reasoning Engine Seeking Pre-Seed/Seed Investment

---

Dear Sentiero Ventures Team,

Your focus on AI-enabled SaaS solutions at the pre-seed and seed stage caught my attention—Ardia Health is building exactly this for healthcare's most pressing challenge: chronic disease management.

**Why This Matters Now:**
Healthcare AI is projected to reach $187B by 2030, yet most solutions focus on acute care imaging or single-condition applications. Independent clinics managing chronic conditions like asthma, COPD, and kidney disease have been underserved by AI innovation.

**What We've Built:**
Ardia Health's Clinical Reasoning Engine is an AI-powered SaaS platform that:
- Delivers **multi-signal correlation** across patient data (not single-point alerts)
- Provides **clinical justification** that providers can trust and act upon
- Integrates via **standard healthcare APIs** with minimal implementation friction
- Scales as a **B2B SaaS model** with recurring revenue per clinic

**Traction:**
- Dashboard and platform built and ready for pilot deployment
- Targeting 15+ independent clinics in the Denton/North DFW corridor
- Clear path to $50K MRR within 12 months post-funding

Given your portfolio includes DocQ and Acclinate, I believe you understand the complexity of healthcare AI adoption. I'd appreciate 20 minutes to demonstrate our platform and discuss partnership.

You can view our interactive business documents and architecture here:

I have also attached our pitch deck and a technical whitepaper for your convenience.
