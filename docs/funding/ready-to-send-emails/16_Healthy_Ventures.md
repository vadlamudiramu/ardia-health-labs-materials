**Subject:** Digital Health Seed Investment: Clinical Reasoning Engine for Chronic Care

---

Dear Healthy Ventures Team,

Your focus on digital health technologies that scale healthcare—combined with your seed-stage focus and typical check sizes of $1-3M—aligns with what we're seeking at Ardia Health.

**Why We Fit Your Thesis:**
✅ Digital health technology (not therapeutics or pure services)  
✅ Tech-enabled service that scales  
✅ Seed stage seeking meaningful early investment  
✅ Team that adapts and evolves with market conditions  

**The Problem:**
Independent clinics managing chronic conditions lack AI tools that provide actionable clinical intelligence. Existing solutions either focus on acute care (Viz.ai, Aidoc) or deliver alert fatigue without clinical reasoning.

**Our Solution:**
Ardia Health's Clinical Reasoning Engine:
- Provides explainable clinical recommendations
- Covers 20+ chronic conditions in unified platform
- Demonstrates ROI within 90 days
- Scales as B2B SaaS with predictable revenue

**Traction:**
- Platform built and demonstrated
- 15+ clinic pipeline in target market
- Clear path to commercial deployment

Your portfolio includes Season Health and Concert Health—tech-enabled solutions addressing specific healthcare challenges. Ardia Health addresses chronic disease management, the largest healthcare challenge by spending.

I'd welcome the opportunity to pitch and discuss investment.
