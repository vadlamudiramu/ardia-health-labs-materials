Dear Margaret,

Flare Capital's emphasis on deep relationships with healthcare strategics—demonstrated by your portfolio including HealthVerity and Iora Health—aligns with our go-to-market strategy at Ardia Health.

**Strategic Partnership Potential:**
We're building a Clinical Reasoning Engine for chronic disease management that health systems and payers need for value-based care success. Your relationships with healthcare strategics can accelerate our enterprise adoption.

**Our Platform:**
- Explainable AI for chronic conditions (asthma, COPD, kidney disease + 17 more)
- Demonstrated ROI: 65% ER reduction, $200K+ annual clinic revenue
- Enterprise-ready with healthcare compliance built-in
- B2B SaaS model with predictable revenue

**Why Flare Capital:**
Your investment flexibility ($100K-$10M) and Rock Health partnership provide exactly the strategic support we need. We're seeking investors who bring healthcare industry relationships alongside capital.

**Market Opportunity:**
Chronic conditions = 90% of healthcare spending. Enterprise health systems are seeking AI solutions for value-based care—we provide the clinical intelligence layer they need.

I'd welcome the opportunity to present our platform and discuss partnership.
