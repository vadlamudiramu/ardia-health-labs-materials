---

Dear Tunde,

7wireVentures' focus on enabling informed and connected health consumers resonates deeply with Ardia Health's mission. Your success with Livongo proved that technology can transform chronic condition management—we're building the next evolution.

**Extending the Livongo Thesis:**
Livongo demonstrated that connected health improves chronic disease outcomes. Ardia Health provides the **clinical reasoning layer** that transforms connected data into actionable intelligence for both patients and providers.

**Our Platform:**
- **For Patients:** Clear, understandable insights about their chronic conditions
- **For Providers:** Explainable AI recommendations they can trust and act upon
- **For Health Systems:** Measurable outcomes (65% ER reduction) and ROI

**Market Focus:**
We're targeting the underserved independent clinic market—practices managing asthma, COPD, and kidney disease that lack enterprise-level AI tools but need clinical decision support.

**Why 7wireVentures:**
Your operator-focused approach—healthcare leaders who get in the trenches with founders—is exactly what we need as we move from platform development to commercial deployment.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss how Ardia Health fits your thesis of informed, connected health consumers.
