**Subject:** Growth-Stage Healthcare AI: Clinical Reasoning Engine Aligned with Your Investment Focus

---

Dear Ms. Wołoszyn and AI Healthcare Capital Team,

Your investment focus on AI applications throughout the care continuum—from symptom assessment to remote patient monitoring—describes exactly what Ardia Health has built for chronic disease management.

**Direct Alignment with Your Thesis:**
Your five focus areas map directly to our platform capabilities:
- ✅ AI-Powered Care Navigation → Our reasoning engine guides clinical decisions
- ✅ AI-Assisted Patient Visits → Real-time clinical intelligence during encounters
- ✅ AI-Enhanced Post-Visit Care → Continuous monitoring and intervention triggers
- ✅ AI-Driven Workflow Automation → Streamlined care management workflows
- ✅ AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring → Integration with RPM data for chronic conditions

**Our Differentiation:**
While most healthcare AI focuses on acute care (radiology, stroke detection), Ardia Health addresses the **90% of healthcare spending** driven by chronic conditions. Our Clinical Reasoning Engine covers asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, and 17+ additional conditions in a unified platform.

**Why Now:**
Healthcare AI spending tripled in 2025 to $1.4B. Independent clinics are actively seeking AI solutions that demonstrate ROI without requiring massive implementation efforts. We're positioned to capture this market with a proven platform.

I would be honored to present to your team and discuss how Ardia Health fits your growth-stage healthcare AI portfolio.

Best regards,
