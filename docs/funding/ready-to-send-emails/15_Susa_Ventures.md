Dear Dr. En'Wezoh,

Susa Ventures' focus on businesses with strong compounding moats based on proprietary data describes the defensibility we're building at Ardia Health.

**Our Data Moat:**
Every clinical decision our reasoning engine supports generates training data that makes our algorithms smarter. Unlike alert-based systems that don't learn from outcomes, our platform improves with every patient interaction—creating a compounding advantage.

**Alignment with Your Focus Areas:**
| Susa Focus | Ardia Health |
|------------|-------------------|
| Data integration & analytics | Multi-signal correlation across patient data |
| Clinical infrastructure & workflows | Reasoning engine integrates into clinical workflows |
| Care coordination & delivery | Intelligent care management for chronic conditions |

**Why Chronic Care:**
Your portfolio includes Photon and The Wound Co—solutions addressing specific clinical needs. Chronic disease management (asthma, COPD, CKD) represents the largest unaddressed need in healthcare AI, with 90% of spending but minimal innovation.

**Series A Preparation:**
Susa's exceptional capabilities in helping seed-stage founders raise Series A funding is highly attractive. We're seeking partners who can help us build toward meaningful growth milestones.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss how Ardia Health fits your investment thesis.

Best regards,  
Ram Vadlamudi  
Founder, Ardia Health
