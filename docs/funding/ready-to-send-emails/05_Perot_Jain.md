Dear Perot Jain Team,

Your investment approach—combining enterprise relationships with operational expertise in healthcare—resonates with what we're building at Ardia Health.

**The Infrastructure Gap:**
Healthcare has invested billions in EHRs and data collection, yet independent clinics managing chronic conditions lack the intelligence layer to transform this data into actionable clinical decisions. This isn't a software problem—it's an infrastructure problem.

**Ardia Health's Solution:**
We've developed a Clinical Reasoning Engine that serves as the intelligence infrastructure for chronic care management:
- Integrates with existing healthcare data systems
- Provides real-world clinical reasoning (not just pattern matching)
- Scales across multiple chronic conditions and clinic sizes
- Delivers measurable outcomes: reduced ER visits, improved care quality, optimized revenue

**Why Perot Jain:**
Your portfolio demonstrates willingness to invest in technically ambitious companies building real-world infrastructure. Ardia Health is building the clinical intelligence infrastructure that independent healthcare practices need to compete and deliver better patient outcomes.

I'd welcome a conversation about how our vision aligns with your healthcare investment thesis.
