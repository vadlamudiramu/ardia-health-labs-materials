Dear Bill and Rock Health Team,

Rock Health's focus on software and data-driven business models in healthcare—combined with your selectivity (4-5 deals/year)—suggests you're looking for exceptional opportunities. I believe Ardia Health qualifies.

**Why We Fit Your Thesis:**
✅ Software and data-driven (not services-only)  
✅ Technology-enabled solution that scales  
✅ Clear clinical utility with measurable outcomes  
✅ Not drugs, diagnostics, or medical devices  

**The Gap We Fill:**
Your portfolio includes Omada Health (chronic condition coaching) and Collective Health (benefits administration). Ardia Health provides the **clinical intelligence layer** between data collection and care delivery—the reasoning engine that makes chronic disease data actionable.

**Our Approach:**
| Aspect | Ardia Health |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Model** | B2B SaaS |
| **Target** | Independent clinics, health systems |
| **Conditions** | Asthma, COPD, CKD + 17 more |
| **Differentiation** | Reasoning (not alerting), explainable AI |

**Corporate Network Value:**
Rock Health's advisory practice and corporate connections would be invaluable as we engage health systems and payers. We're seeking investors who bring strategic value beyond capital.

I'd welcome the opportunity to present to your team.
