**Subject:** Early-Stage MedTech Opportunity: Clinical Reasoning Engine for Chronic Disease Management

---

Dear SHD Partners Team,

I'm reaching out because SHD Partners' focus on early-stage medtech companies that address unmet clinical needs with easily adoptable technologies aligns perfectly with what we're building at Ardia Health.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Independent clinics managing chronic conditions (asthma, COPD, CKD) face a critical gap: existing AI tools either focus narrowly on acute care or deliver alert fatigue without actionable clinical reasoning. Providers need a platform that thinks like a clinician, not one that just flags data points.

**Our Solution:**
Ardia Health has developed a Clinical Reasoning Engine that:
- Provides **explainable clinical justifications** (not just alerts)
- Covers **20+ chronic conditions** in a single platform
- Reduces ER visits by up to **65%** based on early pilot data
- Generates **$200K+ annual revenue** for clinics through optimized care management

**Why SHD Partners:**
Your investment philosophy—targeting easily adoptable technologies with near-term value inflection points—describes our platform exactly. We're currently engaging independent clinics in the DFW region and demonstrating measurable outcomes within 90 days of deployment.

I'd welcome the opportunity to share our clinical dashboard demonstration and discuss how Ardia Health fits your portfolio thesis.
