---

Dear North Texas Angel Network Members,

I'm presenting Ardia Health as an investment opportunity for your network—a healthcare AI company developing a Clinical Reasoning Engine for chronic disease management.

**Investment Highlights:**

| Metric | Ardia Health |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Market** | $50B+ chronic care management |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed/Seed |
| **Ask** | $500K-$750K (syndicate round) |
| **Use of Funds** | Pilot deployments, sales, clinical validation |
| **Target Returns** | 10x+ based on healthcare AI comparables |

**Why This Matters:**
- Chronic conditions = 90% of US healthcare spending
- Independent clinics are underserved by existing AI solutions
- Our platform delivers measurable ROI within 90 days

**Competitive Advantage:**
Unlike Tempus (oncology-focused) or Viz.ai (acute care), Ardia Health provides clinical reasoning for 20+ chronic conditions—a massive market with minimal AI competition.

**Local Impact:**
As a DFW-based company, your investment supports local healthcare innovation while targeting a national market opportunity.

I'd welcome the opportunity to present at your next meeting and discuss investment terms.

You can view our interactive business documents and architecture here:
