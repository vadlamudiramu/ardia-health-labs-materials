**Our Solution:**
ArdiA Health Labs has developed a Clinical Reasoning Engine that:
- Provides **explainable clinical justifications** (not just alerts)
- Covers **20+ chronic conditions** in a single platform
- Reduces ER visits by up to **65%** based on early pilot data
- Generates **$200K+ annual revenue** for clinics through optimized care management

**Why SHD Partners:**
Your investment philosophy—targeting easily adoptable technologies with near-term value inflection points—describes our platform exactly. We're currently engaging independent clinics in the DFW region and demonstrating measurable outcomes within 90 days of deployment.
