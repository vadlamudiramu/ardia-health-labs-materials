## 1. Executive Summary

**Ardia Health** is a healthcare AI company developing a Clinical Intelligence Engine that transforms chronic disease management for independent medical practices. Our platform moves healthcare "from alerting to solving" by providing explainable, actionable clinical recommendations rather than alert-based notifications that contribute to clinician fatigue.

### Key Highlights

- **Market**: $50B+ chronic care management market, with 90% of US healthcare spending on chronic diseases
- **Solution**: AI-powered Clinical Reasoning Engine covering 20+ chronic conditions
- **Differentiation**: Explainable AI with clinical reasoning vs. black-box alert systems
- **Traction**: Platform demonstrated, 15+ clinic pipeline, 65% ER reduction in pilots
- **Business Model**: B2B SaaS with $15-25/patient/month pricing
- **Ask**: $500K-$1M seed round for pilot expansion and commercial deployment

## 3. Problem & Market Opportunity

### The Problem

Chronic diseases account for **90% of the $4.1 trillion** in annual US healthcare spending. Independent clinics managing conditions like asthma, COPD, and chronic kidney disease face critical challenges:

#### Challenge 1: Alert Fatigue
Current clinical decision support systems generate hundreds of alerts daily. Studies show **70-90% of alerts are overridden** or ignored, rendering these systems ineffective and contributing to clinician burnout.

#### Challenge 2: Missed Revenue Opportunity
Chronic Care Management (CCM) and Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) programs offer significant reimbursement opportunities, but administrative burden prevents most independent practices from capturing this revenue. The average practice leaves **$200,000+ annually** on the table.

#### Challenge 3: Preventable Hospitalizations
Patients with chronic conditions frequently experience preventable ER visits and hospitalizations. Each avoided ER visit saves approximately **$3,800** in direct costs and improves patient outcomes.

#### Challenge 4: Technology Gap
Large health systems have access to sophisticated AI tools and dedicated care management teams. Independent practices—serving millions of patients—lack comparable resources, creating a widening quality gap.

### Market Opportunity

| Market Segment | Size |
|----------------|------|
| **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** | $50B+ (chronic care management market) |
| **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)** | $5B (independent practices, pulmonology, nephrology) |
| **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** | $100M (DFW and surrounding regions, Year 3) |

### Market Dynamics

- **Healthcare AI spending** reached $1.4B in 2025, nearly 3x 2024 levels
- **85% of healthcare AI spending** flows to startups vs. legacy vendors
- **22% of healthcare organizations** now implement domain-specific AI tools (7x YoY growth)
- **Eight healthcare AI unicorns** have emerged—more than any other vertical AI segment

### Target Market: Dallas-Fort Worth

DFW represents an ideal initial market:

- **$1.2B** in healthcare startup funding (2025)
- **ARPA-H Innovation Hub** designation ($2.5B initiative)
- **Competitive payer landscape** (BCBS 30%, UHC 28%) driving innovation adoption
- **Strong independent practice ecosystem** with 50+ target clinics identified

## 4. Solution & Product

### Product Overview

The **Ardia Clinical Intelligence Engine** is an AI-powered platform that transforms chronic disease management through:

1. **Multi-Signal Correlation**: Analyzes data across symptoms, vital signs, environmental factors, patient history, and connected devices
2. **Clinical Reasoning**: Provides specific recommendations with explainable rationale
3. **Workflow Automation**: Handles CCM/RTM documentation, coding, and billing
4. **EHR Integration**: Connects via FHIR APIs to existing practice systems

### How It Works

**Traditional Alert System:**
> "Alert: Patient peak flow reading is low"

**Ardia Clinical Intelligence Engine:**
> "Recommendation: Initiate nasal steroid therapy today.
> 
> Reasoning: Peak flow has declined 15% over 3 days, voice analysis shows increased nasal resonance, environmental pollen at 3x threshold, and patient history shows steroid-responsive pattern. Early intervention prevents the exacerbation pattern seen in 4 of last 6 similar episodes."
